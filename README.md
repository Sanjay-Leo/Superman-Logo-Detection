# Superman-Logo-Detection

> **This program actually works to detect red color.. so it only identifies**
the superman logo

Again finding those accurate HSV range is hectic job
there are online tool through which we can get.. but those values didnt work,
for different colors thier values provided works magnificently
but specially for red the accurate value is needed

so i made a tracebar to find it myself
